        <h1>Kalman Filter</h1>
        <p>The Kalman Filter is an algorithm for estimating the state of a system in the presence of uncertainty. The
            algorithm was developed by the Hungarian-American engineer Rudolf E. Kálmán and is ubiquitous today in
            applications such as robotics, navigation and control.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest advantages of the Kalman Filter is its ability to combine measurements from multiple
            different
            sensors into one model.</p>
        <p>The goal of this website is to offer an interactive playground in order to gain a better intuition for the
            effects of the algorithm. </p>
        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <p>We will have a short introduction on the theory behind the Kalman Filter before playing around with it.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Application</h2>
        <p>We will look at the following simplified use case for a Kalman Filter: A car is
            driving in one direction with changing velocity <b>v</b> over a period of time. We are trying to predict
            the
            current position of the car at all times. However we only periodically receive measurements of the current
            velocity from the speedometer and the current position from a GPS sensor. Moreover, both sensors are
            imperfect and deliver
            noisy data.</p>
        <p>The real velocity and driven distance (that we are trying to find) are shown in the following plots:</p>
